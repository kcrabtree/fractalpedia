                The inspiration for this project came from
                <a
                    href="https://wiki.fractalaudio.com/wiki/index.php?title=Yeks_Guide_to_the_Fractal_Audio_Amp_Models"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="inline-link">Yek's Guide to the Fractal Audio Amplifier Models</a>. The goal was to transform
                a PDF that was infrequently updated, and has fallen out of date, into a fully-interactive trove of
                knowledge driven and powered by Fractal users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nearly all initial content on FractalPedia came from the guide, and this site simply would not have been
                possible without the generosity of Yek, simviz, and all the other forum members who contributed in one
                way or another - thank you all! Neither one of these things would've been possible without the hard work
                and ingenuity of Cliff and his team; many thanks to everyone at FAS as well!
            </p>

                I truly hope this site is useful to the community and evolves into a comprehensive resource over time.
